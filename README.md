# ARCHIVED
This project was mostly just me dipping my toes in neovim for the first real time after switching to nix. I don't use this architecture anymore, nor should anyone really.. Regardless it was a cute good kickstarter for both nix and vim, so I've just decided to archive it instead of delete it.

My custom nvim config! Mostly yoinked code from QuantumCoded/neovim & nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim.

Runnable with ``nix run github:kyleraykbs/KyVim``
